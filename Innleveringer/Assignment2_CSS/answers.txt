1. Use #id when you want to style a unique element on a page, and use .class when you want to style multiple elements with the same style rules.

Example: Use #header to style a unique page header and use .button to style all buttons with the same characteristics.

2. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. You can express any color by combining values for red, green, and blue (each ranging from 0-255), and you can adjust the opacity of the color using the alpha channel (a value between 0-1, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque).

3. One possible solution is "article p", as this will select all p tags that are inside an article tag, no matter how deeply nested they are. Another possible solution that will work in this case is "article > p", which will select all p tags that are direct children of an article tag. If there would be other tags between the article and the p tag, this selector would not work, however.
